# Landing page and blog

Codeable First week extended project.

[Design](https://www.figma.com/file/JtEy9nbmlkWA0nkK2lqXxb/Extended-Project-Week-1?node-id=9492%3A300)

## Instructions

Build the landing page in `index.html`. You can
name the rest of the files whatever you prefer.

To run the site you can just open the HTML file with your browser
or you can run a small static file server by using the command
`npx server` and visit `http://localhost:5000`

Assets are in the assets folder ðŸ˜„

Good luck!
